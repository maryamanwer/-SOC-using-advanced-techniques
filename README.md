# Security Operations Center (SOC) Final Report

## Description
This report explores the role of Security Operations Centers (SOC) in modern cybersecurity and investigates how machine learning can enhance SOC capabilities. The study focuses on the implementation of Splunk for real-time cyber threat detection and response, demonstrating how machine learning algorithms can reduce false positives and improve security operations. The research includes a comparative analysis of static rule-based detection versus ML-driven approaches, along with practical implementation using the Splunk ML Toolkit.
